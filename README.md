# Odin Recipes

## Project Description
This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum and serves as an introduction to building basic web pages using HTML. The goal is to create a simple recipe website that links to individual recipe pages.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Proficiency in basic HTML structure and semantic elements.
- The ability to use internal and external links.
- Organizing a project using proper file and folder structures.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Click on any recipe link to view the recipe details.

## Future Goals
- Add basic CSS for styling.
- Include more recipes with images and advanced formatting.

## Self-Reflection

### What I Learned
- I learned how to create a basic HTML website with multiple linked pages.
- I now understand how to use unordered and ordered lists to display information effectively.
- I became more familiar with Git for version control and managing project files.

### Challenges Faced
- Initially, I struggled with setting up relative paths for linking the recipe pages, but I resolved it by reviewing how file structures work in a project.
- Remembering to save and refresh the browser after every change was tricky at first, but I developed a routine to ensure updates appeared as expected.
